RackerHank Interview (Removable Characters in a String)

- Medium

```
Given two strings, str1, and str2, where str1 contains exactly one character more than str2, find the indices of the characters in str1 that can be removed to make str1 equal to str2. Return the array of indices in increasing order. If it is not possible, return the array \[-1\]. 

Note: Use 0-based indexing.

Example

str1 = "abdgggda"

str2 = "abdggda"

Any "g" character at positions 3, 4, or 5 can be deleted to obtain str2. Return \[3, 4, 5\].

[RackerHank - Day 10: Binary Number](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-binary-numbers/problem)

**Task**
Given a base-10 integer, , convert it to binary (base-2). Then find and print the base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in n's binary representation. When working with different bases, it is common to show the base as a subscript.

**Example**
The binary representation of 120-base10 is 1111101-base2. In base 10, there are 5 and 1 consecutive ones in two groups. Print the maximum, 5.

**Input Format**

A single integer, n.

**Constraints**
1 < n < 10⁶

**Output Format**

Print a single base-10 integer that denotes the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the binary representation of n.

**Sample Input 1**
``
5
``
**Sample Output 1**
``
1
``
**Sample Input 2**
``
13
``
**Sample Output 2**
``
2
``
**Explanation**

Sample Case 1:
The binary representation of 5-base10 is 101-base2, so the maximum number of consecutive 1's is 1.

Sample Case 2:
The binary representation of 13-base10 is 1101-base2, so the maximum number of consecutive 1's is 2.
