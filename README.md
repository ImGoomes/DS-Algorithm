# Data Structure & Algorithm Training

This project is dedicated to solving LeetCode and HackerRank problems using various programming languages. It serves as a practice ground to enhance problem-solving skills and explore different approaches to coding challenges.

## Goals
- Improve algorithmic thinking.
- Gain proficiency in multiple programming languages.
- Build a repository of solutions for reference.

## Structure
The project is organized by:
- **Language**: Solutions implemented in different programming languages.
- **Problem**: Each problem has its own reference inside problems files.

## How to Use
1. Review the problem description in the URL provided in [problems.md](./problems.md).

2. Navigate to the desired problem.

3. Explore the solution files for implementations in various languages.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute by:
- Adding new solutions.
- Improving existing solutions.
- Documenting problem-solving approaches.

Valeu, flw!
